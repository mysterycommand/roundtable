# Roundtable

> An experimental WebRTC monorepo, namespaced under `@rnd` (for "research 'n' development" but also an abbreviation of "round" but also an abbreviation of "random")<br />

#### Notes

You may need to run `npm --global install node-pre-gyp` (or `npm -g i node-pre-gyp`) before running `npm i` here, the `wrtc` package seems to have an issue with `npm@7` (which this repo uses).
